## This is the document for private key creation for any linux user.

Generate SSH Key Pair for the User
Run the following on your Linux machine (where the user exists):

sudo -u <username> ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "<username>@jenkins" -f /home/<username>/.ssh/id_rsa


* Replace <username> with your actual Linux username. *

When prompted for a passphrase, leave it empty (unless you want extra security).

This will create:

/home/<username>/.ssh/id_rsa (private key)

/home/<username>/.ssh/id_rsa.pub (public key)

 Add the Public Key to authorized_keys
Ensure the public key is authorized for SSH login:

sudo -u <username> bash -c 'cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys'


Also make sure permissions are correct:

sudo chown -R <username>:<username> /home/<username>/.ssh
sudo chmod 700 /home/<username>/.ssh
sudo chmod 600 /home/<username>/.ssh/id_rsa


Now you can access the server using is.rsa private key
